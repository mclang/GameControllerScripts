# Game Controller Scripts
Collection of tools that I use when playing games like Freespace, I-WAR 2: Edge of Chaos and Mechwarrior: Online.

The joystick I am using is Thrustmaster Warthog with [DIY extension](https://imgur.com/a/6lF6C). The extension makes movement much smoother near the center detent, which is one of the only downsides the Warthog has, besides the gimbal being plastic.

My throttle is Thrustmaster HOTAS X, which has a nice rocking lever on the front that makes turning e.g mech legs easy and smooth. The throttle is also modified quite a bit as seen in my [HOTAS X DIY](https://imgur.com/gallery/dn2EJdg) project images.
