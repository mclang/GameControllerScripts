# Game Controller Scripts
Collection of tools that I use when playing games like Freespace, I-WAR 2: Edge of Chaos and Mechwarrior: Online.

The joystick I am using is Thrustmaster Warthog with [DIY extension](https://imgur.com/gallery/6lF6C). The extension makes movement much smoother near the center detent, which is one of the few downsides the Warthog has, besides the gimbal being plastic.

My throttle is the one from _Thrustmaster T Flight HOTAS X_ combo. While being cheap and plastic, it has a nice rocking lever on the front that makes turning e.g mech legs easy and smooth. No other throttle except newer _Thrustmaster TWCS Throttle_ has this kind of lever, so my options were limited. The throttle is also modified quite a bit as seen in my [HOTAS X DIY](https://imgur.com/gallery/4rLNjoA) project gallery.

#### Word of advice:
Don't buy Warthog HOTAS or anything cheap from Thrustmaster, not even T.16000M Joystick or FCS combo! Get something from [Virpil](https://virpil-controls.eu/) or [VKB](https://flightsimcontrols.com/) instead.

Check for example [VKB Gladiator](https://flightsimcontrols.com/product/vkb-sim-gladiator-mk-ii-joystick/) that isn't so much more expensive than T.16000M, but runs around it circles in quality wise.
