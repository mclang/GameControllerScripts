#AHK - Universal Joystick Remapper (UJR)

UJR is a stand-alone application written in AutoHotkey.   
It is distributed in compiled form, so please do not attempt to download the source from Github unless you know what you are doing.

#####The regular download link for end-users is [HERE]( http://evilc.com/proj/ujr).

UJR is an application for taking axes or buttons from one or more physical joysticks, and merging them onto a virtual joystick (with tweaks such as axis inversion, deadzones, sensitivity etc).

It is used by gamers to fine tune behavior of sticks and perform operations not normally possible such as merge two pedal axes into one "rudder axis."

WARNING: UJR does "Phone Home" to check version number (it reads a text file from my web site) so it can let you know if a newer version is available. This behavior is non-malicious, but any attempt by any version of UJR to do anything else network-wise should be considered malicious and a result of a modified or infected file.

If in doubt, download from github and use the uncompiled version, or compile it yourself.

Here are some screenshots of UJR in action:
