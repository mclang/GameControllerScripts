= : Change / Fix
+ : Added feature

6.10 - 2nd Nov 2015
+ Compiled with ADHD 3.3.4
Reverted out change made in 6.9 - UJR would no longer run for many users

6.9 - 8th Oct 2015
+ Compiled with ADHD 3.3.3
As a result, you should no longer get a UAC prompt every time UJR starts. You should see it once, then it should not appear again.

6.8 - 6th Oct 2015
= Functionality Toggle binding now works. You can turn on/off UJR's functionality with this binding.

6.7 - 16th July 2015
= Greatest mode now works in a  more logical manner - it should now behave similarly to Merge mode.
= CPU load reduced - GUI controls for axes that are not being used are no longer continually updated.

6.6 - 24th Dec 2014
! Now tries to use the vJoy DLLs from the vJoy installation folder.
  PLEASE ENSURE YOU ARE USING THE LATEST VERSION OF VJOY!
+ Added in-app links to Github / Forum etc.
= Fixed bad maths. UJR now correctly uses output values in the range 0->32768, not 0->32767
  Shouldn't really affect much, such a small deviation was probably never noticed!
= "Greatest" merge mode fix for pedals (Rests L/H axes) - thanks to CJBrew for this one!
! For those that use the AHK version, the vjoy library is now a separate project:
  https://github.com/evilC/AHK-vJoy-Library

6.5 26th Aug 2014
+ Trim mode added to axis merging features - you can now use one axis to trim another axis.
  Code contributed by PhoenixBvo, thanks!

6.4 22nd May 2014
= Updated to use latest version of ADHD
+ Bindings tab changed - no more Program Mode or ticking of Ctrl, Alt, Shift boxes.

6.3 12th Dec 2013
= Fixed missing 9-16 option for dropdowns to select stick ID for buttons, hats etc.

6.2 12th Dec 2013
+ UJR now supports 16 physical joysticks (The max windows supports), instead of 8.

6.1 10th Dec 2013
= Fixed bug with axis merging.
  Axis was being flipped in "Rests H" mode, also deadzone was applying wrong.
  Sorry! I have no idea what I was smoking when I wrote that code!

6.0 7th Dec 2013
! Profiles from previous versions of UJR are not compatible with this version
  Please delete or re-name uhr.ini
! VJoy library was updated - be sure to copy the contents of VJoyLib folder over old copy!
= Changed Axis Merging mechanism
  Should be simpler to understand now
+ Axes and Buttons unavailable on the virtual stick are now disabled in UJR.
  If your virtual stick only has 16 buttons, buttons 17-32 will be disabled in UJR.
+ Real-time detection of available axes / buttons.
  If you alter the virtual stick config with UJR running, it will detect the changes and update accordingly.
+ Can now control different virtual sticks and swap virtual stick on the fly.
+ Can now run multiple copies of UJR simultaneously.
  Each copy of UJR can control a different virtual stick.
+ Axis Splitting
  Can now use half a physical axis to control a virtual axis
+ Improved Deadzone / Sensitivity support
  Per-axis dz / sens support when doing axis merging
  Rest High / Low mode for applying dz / sens to one end of an axis (For throttle / pedal like axes)
= Fixed bug with Copying profiles (Exiting and reloading would not result in copied profile being the current one)

5.4 30th Nov 2013
= Modification to VJoy library - it can now correctly control virtual stick IDs other than 1.
  No actual changes to UJR, but it would now be easy to make UJR control any virtual stick ID (Currently thru a code edit).
  BE SURE TO COPY THE VJOYLIB FOLDER FROM THE ZIP INTO YOUR UJR FOLDER - THAT IS WHERE THE MAIN CHANGE IS!

5.3 25th Nov 2013
= Reduced likelihood of a merged axis "kicking" in one direction.
  Previously, when building the virtual axis, the value of the first axis would be applied,
  then the value of the second axis would be averaged in and the virtual axis would be set again.
  This could result in jerky movement if there was too long between the two physical axes being processed.
  The virtual axis is now only set when both physical axes have been read and added together.

5.2 25th Nov 2013
! Axis merging has changed!
  It is now much less confusing to set up - configure each axis individually to move the slider in the direction desired.
  eg set the left pedal to move the slider left (from a resting position all the way right), right pedal to move it right.
  Then set both axes to the same virtual axis and enable merge - it should behave as expected.
+ Now detects if something else is controlling the virtual stick (maybe you tried to run ahk and exe versions of UJR?) and exits.

5.1 21st Nov 2013
+ Added "QuickBind" function - bind game functions without leaving the game!
  Instead of manually selecting an axis or button by using the QB radio button, you can use QuickSelect.
  Bind QuickSelect to something, and when you hit it, press a button or move an axis.
  The relevant axis or button will then be selected for you.
+ "Auto Configure" function - quickly set up a straight through mapping for all buttons or axes.

5.0 20th Nov 2013
* Rewrite using my ADHD library.
! Now intended to be used when compiled to an EXE - You no longer need AutoHotkey installed.
! Old profile files are NOT COMPATIBLE.
  However, it is just the groups etc in the INI that will not work right.
  If you create a new profile, exit UJR and paste in the contents of the old profile, it may well work.
= Manual Control is gone, replaced by QuickBind
= Profile support improved
= Less tabs
= Improved hat switch support (QuickBind supports hats, whereas Manual Control did not)
= Detect Axis gone for now, it will probably return

4.3
+ Basic Hat (POV) switch support.
As AHK only supports one hat per stick, it is very basic for the moment.
It currently only supports Continuous POVs.
Currently there is no "manual control" mode for the hats

4.2
= Duplicate in profiles was always duplicating the Default profile, no matter what you had selected - fixed.
+ Added Delete Profile button

4.1
+ Duplicate profile added.

4.0
+ Profile support added.
INI file format changed, there are now two INI files - one for misc settings, one for profiles
Existing mappings are kept and moved to the default profile
Manual profile switching only for now...

3.2
+ The first physical POV Hat can now be mapped to virtual buttons. AHK only supports reading one POV :(

3.1
+ Sensitivity option for each axis.

3.0
! Please note that the format of the config file has changed, the program will back your old one up
= Fixed bug stopping button mappings not saving
= Improved UI layout, labels etc
= Major cleanup of code - now much more understandable
+ GUI position now saved in config file - when you close the app, next time you reopen it, it will be in the same place on your desktop
+ Only settings changed from their default setting are stored in the config file
+ Detect axis button! Use this to try and find out the stick ID of a physical stick.
Instructions now simplified
+ Experimental - Merging of axes
eg Merge two pedal axes into a rudder axis


2.3
+ Much improved deadzone code
  So with a 50% deadzone, if you move to 50 on an axis, it will be dead, but moving to 51 now outputs 1 rather than 51
+ Deadzone is now a text input field, so you can use any value you like
+ Input / Output slider renamed to "State"
+ Input and Output values for axes now displayed
+ Much more commented code

2.2
+ Added per-axis deadzone settings. Just 5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70 or 80 percent at the moment but I intend to allow any figure in a future version

2.1
= Fixed bug stopping UJR from working on 64-bit AHK installs.
= Fixed bug stopping mapping of virtual axis 4 or greater
+ 32 Buttons listed for physical joystick

2.0
+ Now uses Axlar's vJoy library (http://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/87690-using-ahk-to-control-vjoy)
+ Now uses vJoy 2.x - Support for up to 32 buttons
You will NEED to uninstall vJoy 1.x and install 2.x to use this version

1.1
= Code for button testing no longer has one subroutine per button
= Optimised technique for inverting axes - thanks Babba on AHK forums!

1.0
* Fully functional basic version!
= Fixed bug stopping invert working in Manual Control mode
+ Button mapping in

0.3
+ Settings now saved in an INI file

0.2
+ All 8 axes now mappable
+ Code optimisations

0.1
* Initial Proof of concept
